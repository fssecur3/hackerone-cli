## Description

This is an (unofficial) utility that works as a client to the HackerOne platform. It allows you to perform multiple operations directly from the command-line.  
The tool uses the official [HackerOne API](https://api.hackerone.com/) to access the data it needs.  
It contains several modules so you manage and view information related to your profile, reports, programs, payments, etc and it's really easy to use.

## Usage

### Windows

After installing, just run `python3 hackerone.py` to use the utility.

### Unix

After installing, you can call `hackerone` directly from the command-line (since a symbolic link will be created during installation) or use python (`python3 hackerone.py`).

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- Git
- HackerOne API Key (you can get it from [here](https://hackerone.com/settings/api_token/edit))

### Windows

1. Open Powershell in the same directory as the project
2. Run the installation file:

    ```ps1
    .\install.ps1
    ```

3. Export the required environment variables (don't forget to replace the values between double quotes):

    ```ps1
    echo 'HACKERONE_USERNAME="<username>"' > .env
    echo 'HACKERONE_API_KEY="<api-key>"' >> .env
    ```

    or

    ```ps1
    $env:HACKERONE_USERNAME = "<username>"
    $env:HACKERONE_API_KEY = "<api-key>"
    ```

### Unix

1. Open a shell in the same directory as the project
2. Run the installation file:

    ```sh
    chmod +x install.sh
    ./install.sh
    ```

3. Export the required environment variables (don't forget to replace the values between double quotes):

    ```sh
    echo 'HACKERONE_USERNAME="<username>"' > .env
    echo 'HACKERONE_API_KEY="<api-key>"' >> .env
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    export HACKERONE_USERNAME="<username>"
    export HACKERONE_API_KEY="<api-key>"
    ```

4. Optionally, you can set the environment variables permanently (if you're not using the first option, in the previous process):

    (using ZSH shell)

    ```sh
    echo 'export HACKERONE_USERNAME="<username>"' >> .zshrc
    echo 'export HACKERONE_API_KEY="<api-key>"' >> .zshrc
    ```

    (using Bash shell)

    ```sh
    echo 'export HACKERONE_USERNAME="<username>"' >> .bashrc
    echo 'export HACKERONE_API_KEY="<api-key>"' >> .bashrc
    ```

### Tests

This tool was tested (and performed well) on:

- Kali Linux 2023.2 + Python 3.11.4
- Windows 11 (Powershell 7.3.5) + Python 3.11.4
- Android (with Termux) + Python 3.11.4

### balance

Check your money balance. The value provided is in the currency provided on your profile.

```txt
hackerone balance

Balance: 1337.0
```

### burp

Downloads the burp configuration file from public programs. This is <u>not</u> done through the HackerOne API, since there's no such feature, that's why it only works with public programs.  
You need to pass the program's handle to use this module. You can find the program handle using the module `programs` or by checking the URL in the browser, while using the HackerOne platform (example: `https://hackerone.com/<handle>/policy_scopes` in any program)

```txt
hackerone burp security

Filename: security-(...).json
```

### csv

Downloads the CSV scope file from public programs. This is <u>not</u> done through the HackerOne API, since there's no such feature, that's why it only works with public programs.  
You need to pass the program's handle to use this module. You can find the program handle using the module `programs` or by checking the URL in the browser, while using the HackerOne platform (example: `https://hackerone.com/<handle>/policy_scopes` in any program)

```txt
hackerone csv security

Filename: scopes_for_security_(...).csv
```

### earnings

Check your earnings from the programs you have been.

```txt
hackerone earnings

### profile

Gets your profile information. It only works if you have any reports, since this module actually checks for the 'reporter' from a report you submitted (there is no user searching / profile feature in the - hacker - API). Unfortunatly it is not possible to get the Signal, Impact or Rank data.

### scope

Save a list of in-scope domains, URLs, IP addresses, CIDR addresses, and wildcards in a text file (to use on external tools).

Optionally, you can pass the name of the output file as a second argument (default: `inscope.txt`).

```txt
hackerone scope scopes_for_example.csv out.txt
